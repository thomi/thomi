I'm Dennis, a Web Devoloper experienced in designing, developing, testing and deploying web applications with 3+ years under my belt.

I work a lot with

-   PHP, Laravel, Javascript, Vue, Ember & Express.
-   Figma & TailwindCSS - designing and converting designs into Web Components.
-   Development box is Linux (Ubuntu and ArchLinux mostly).
-   Deployment using Docker, AWS EC2 Instances, S3 Storage & DigitalOcean.

Mostly, I work with people on all of the above! You can find me on Discord & Twitter sharing all sorts of neat things and probably find out how I've broken and maybe fixed somethings too.

I enjoy

- Designing & building websites for Non-Profit Organizations, where I unleash my creativity to run wild, ship amazing projects & make an impact somewhere.

- An amazing life outside of Tech, while I have a few projects I enjoy, nothing above is close to where I spend most of my time and energy. If you need anything in the above fixed, please feel free to fork it and send me a Pull Request.

Heads up!

-   I’m currently learning Golang and in-depth Web Development using Go.
-   Contributing to open-source initiatives here at home in Africa [here](https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/Team-Rio-Laravel).
