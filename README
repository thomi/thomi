# Hi there¬†üñêÔ∏è

I'm Denny, a software devoloper experienced in designing, developing, testing and deploying web applications with 4+ years under my belt. I am Looking to work where I can impact an organization and grow as a software engineer.

I work a lot with:

-   PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, NodeJS, ExpressJS, & VueJS.
-   Figma & TailwindCSS - designing and converting designs into UI Components.
-   Development box is Linux (Ubuntu and Arch-Linux).
-   Deployment using DigitalOcean, Docker, AWS, & Terraform.

Mostly, I work with people on all of the above! You can find me on Discord or Twitter sharing all sorts of neat things and probably find out how I've broken and maybe fixed somethings too.

I enjoy:

-  All sorts of DIY hacking projects, like building an Erlang BEAM powered [Payment Gateway](#), a simple [CRM tool](#) for small businesses and an IoT device vulnerabilty scanner [Shogun-Scrapper](#).

- An amazing life outside of tech, while I have a few projects, nothing above is close to where I spend most of my time and energy. If you need anything in the above fixed, please feel free to fork it and send me a pull request.

Heads up!

-   I‚Äôm currently learning Go Lang and in-depth Kubernetes Administration.
-   Contributing to sharing knowledge through many tech publications [here](#).
-   Check out what I've been up to below & to know more about me here's my¬†[LinkedIn](#).
